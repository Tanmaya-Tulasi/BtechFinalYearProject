# BtechFinalYearProject

This project involves the design and implementation of improved three interface converter, and B4-Inverter fed brushless direct electric current motor drive 
for industrial uses. The proposed integrated Three Port Converter (ITPC) and B4-Inverter fed Brushless Direct Current Motor (BLDC) drive is proposed. 
It also involves design of MPPT controller to extract maximum power from the converter under various operating conditions. The static and dynamic response of 
the converter has been controlled with various controllers like PID controller and fuzzy controller and the comparison has been provided among various controllers.
The results are validated by performing simulations of the proposed systems in MATLAB/Simulink.
